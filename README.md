## Important Notes

As descirbed in the [root readme](https://github.com/Jaminima/Crypto-Wallet-Wrapper#no-security), this app features no secuirty and should **NEVER** be used in a production enviroment without major security changes. Along with this all data is stored in a flat file format, a SQL like dB may be ideal.
